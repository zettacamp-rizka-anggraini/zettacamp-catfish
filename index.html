                <h2>Description Aboout Me</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="first">I</span> was born and grew up in Yogyakarta. 
                    I have undergone education from kindergarten, elementary, 
                    junior high, high school, to college only in Jogja. I grew 
                    up like a normal child. I have 4 siblings consisting of 2 sisters 
                    and 2 brothers. My father is a former nurse in a private hospital 
                    and so is my mother. I have a busy life following the bootcamp from 
                    zettacamp. from early in the morning until late at night. My house is 
                    located on the southern border of the city. city border between Yogyakarta 
                    and Bantul area. I love books, music and movies. I like to <span class="second">eat</span> and drink water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="first">I</span> had the closest friends when I was in college, about 8 people during semesters 
                    1 to 2. Then it was eroded to 7 people because 1 person moved college to Palembang. 
                    then eroded in semester 4 due to the covid <span class="second">Coronavirus Disease</span> pandemic to about 4 people and then eroded 
                    until now only 1 person. Our friendship has gone through a big storm at every moment 
                    starting from infrequent communication, the conditions of each area, choosing topics to 
                    talk about, to our graduation from college. Yes anyway I am grateful to have experienced 
                    such a pleasant <span class="second">friendship</span>.
